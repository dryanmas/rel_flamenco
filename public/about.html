      <h3>Robert Earl Longley</h3>
      <p>Robert Earl Longley, also known as "Robby" to his friends and fans, is a world-class level guitarist and symphonic composer. His original compositions include ten of his own CDs, three theatrical films, and a two-hour long improvisational performance to a silent film.  Robertâ€™s concert material is a presentation of masterfully executed fingerstyle techniques on the flamenco guitar that delivers sophisticated melodies in symphonic movements unprecedented on solo guitar. The best way to describe his music is to say that if film composer, Ennio Morriconi had only a guitar at his disposal, he would be Robert Earl Longley.</p>
